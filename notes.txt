Tur8inFan! One thing that mIRC does not natively have 
Tur8inFan! is spell-checking

Tur8inFan! one thing it has that some clients do not is tab-completion

Tur8inFan! another feature that I don't think it has
Tur8inFan! but which mibbit has
Tur8inFan! is the feature that lines that highlight one's own nick are highlighted in some way
